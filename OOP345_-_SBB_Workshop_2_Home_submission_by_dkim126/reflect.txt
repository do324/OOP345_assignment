I learned that copy operations can be used when make a copy of a object to another object. 
otherwise, move operations can be used move the resource's ownershop from a object dynamic allocation of addresses to objects instead of objects themselves to anoher object.
copy can not copy in same memory. but, move can be copy in same memory.
also, move constructor and assingment is more faster than copy constructor and assingment.
copy operation is useful when back up is needed. but move opereation dosent need a back up for duplication.
in text.cpp, *this = std::move(src); is move constructor/ this is just moved the string not copy and save string. 
I also learned the way that how std::strings worked with the heap and stack memory. it is useful.
I also learned how to dynamically allocated array to store address to object than just object.
the way that array is declared is pointer. size of array is declared at copile time.
