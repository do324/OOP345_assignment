I learned that Internal linkage refers to everything only in scope of a translation unit. 
Also, External linkage refers to things that exist beyond a particular translation unit. 
In string.cpp, External linkage is used to use likage beyond particular translation unit.
And I learned how to give Command line arguments. 
To pass command line arguments, we have to define main() with two arguments
first argument is the number of command line arguments and 
second is list of command-line arguments.
and i learned again about namespace, class and object.
process()function can creates stirng. and in w1.cpp it is called.
